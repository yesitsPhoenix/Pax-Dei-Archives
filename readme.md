# Pax Dei Archives


Welcome to the Pax Dei Archives! This is a basic website I put together to document items, mobs, maps, skills, magic, and more.
Please do not consider this a full/complete project, it's a proof-of-concept for ideas I had while testing. 

I'm by no means a web developer and barely a programmer. Most of my dev time is spent on Discord-based Bot projects. I used this project to push me out of my comfort zone.
