## Keepers of Hidden Light

* **Origin:** An enduring order derived from the silent rites and protective glyphs established by **Eleleth**.
* **Purpose:** Unlike other orders that sought power or recognition, the Keepers focused on watching and safeguarding the **Ley Lines** and sacred thresholds without claiming them.
* **Current Status:** They are one of the few ancient orders known to still endure in the current **Great Cataclysm**, maintaining a vigilant, silent watch over the remaining flickers of grace in the world.
