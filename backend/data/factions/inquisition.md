Established by Pope Malhenus

> Pope Malhenus established the Inquisition. Its structure echoed the armies of Anatolia, a gesture meant to honor the Eastern Kingdom. In truth, it hollowed it. The finest soldiers pledged not to king or country, but to doctrine. Within a generation, the Inquisition became the greatest military power in the realm.
