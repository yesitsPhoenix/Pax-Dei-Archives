**Age:** ~3900 to present

**Redeemer:** None (The world fractured following the death of Loïos)

**Sins:** Total corruption of thrones and altars; betrayal of sacred thresholds

**Notable Events & Characteristics:**
* Widespread rebellion against Papal corruption began in Anatolia and spread through fellowships like the Covenant of the Last Ember and the Gallian Compagnons.
* The "Last Crusade" occurred—not as a war of conquest, but as a desperate defense of sacred sites by the righteous against both demons and the Inquisition.
* The Inquisition branded noble bloodlines (Sunshield, O'Mara, Grayhawk) as heretics, forcing the faithful into the shadows.
* Iberia was the first to fall to demonic corruption, with cities dissolving into nightmare landscapes rather than falling to siege.
* "The Cleansing": A divine shattering of reality involving a decade of supernatural storms, iron rain, and the cessation of seasons.
* The emergence of "Scions": Mysterious individuals who appeared in the ruins, possessing innate knowledge of the old world and the ability to rise after falling.
* The world remains in a state of fractured recovery, where these Scions carry the last threads of hope for a restored Creation.
