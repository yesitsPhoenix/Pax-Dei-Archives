**Age:** 2996 to ~3900

**Redeemer:** Mellephaneous (Eighth Redeemer) and Loïos (Ninth/Unrecognized Redeemer)

**Sins:** Pride (Pope Maulen), Greed (Inquisition), Sloth (Pope Luseman), and Gluttony/Levity (Papess Senehua)

**Notable Events & Characteristics:**
* Mellephaneous restored order and communion between the Four Kingdoms, ruling for 112 years before vanishing.
* The "Petrae Dei" (standing stones) were raised across the realm to carry doctrine and mobilize the faithful.
* Over eight centuries, the Holy See shifted from spiritual guidance to rigid law, suppressing curiosity and inquiry.
* The Church systematically erased ancient houses and orders (Thornwood, Radiance, Solhart) that preserved older traditions.
* The Inquisition was established, becoming a dominant military power that prioritized doctrine over national loyalty.
* The age ended after the death of Loïos, a barefoot commoner whose quiet message of remembrance led to his suspected poisoning and the subsequent cracking of the Petrae Dei.
