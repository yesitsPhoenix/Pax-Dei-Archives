**Age:** Pre-Creation (The First through Ninth Creations)

**Redeemer:** Unknown

**Sins from past Creations:** Anger (consumed First Creation), Envy (Leviathan), Gluttony, and Levity

**Notable Events & Characteristics:**
* Our current world is the Tenth Creation; nine previous Creations were shaped and subsequently unraveled due to corruption.
* Each fallen Creation was theoretically defined by a specific Deadly Sin and answered by a corresponding Heavenly Virtue in the next iteration.
* The Fay are the "firstborn of an older grace," survivors from a previous fallen world who now reside in hidden realms.
* Non-human creatures (trolls, ogres, wyverns) are remnants of these shattered ages, some saved by the Fay and others shaped by ancient sin.
* Some of the ruins of previous Creations are layered physically and spiritually beneath the current world.
* When sin takes hold in the Creation, it descends through three layers: Rivulets (cultist lairs), Temples (demonic influences), and finally, the point where Creation ends and Hell begins.
* Descending into the depths of the world is described as "tumbling through the sins of history."
