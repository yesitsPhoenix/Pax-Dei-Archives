Before Paradise, before even the first breath of mankind, there were others. Many others.

The world we walk upon is not the first. This is the **Tenth** Creation, and we are its children, but not the creations firstborn.

**Nine** times before, the Divine shaped the tapestry of existence.

Nine times, it unraveled. 

Each Creation was corrupted by a Deadly Sin, rising from within like rot in the root, and each was answered by a Heavenly Virtue, woven into the next.
