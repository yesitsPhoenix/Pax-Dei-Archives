Green were the vales of Lyonesse,
Shining with dew at dawn,
Apple and oak, and corn in sheaves,
Gold on every lawn.

No man hungered in those days,
Nor child went lean with need,
For there was set the Cauldron vast,
That never failed of feed.

They ate, they drank, they ate again,
Till bellies swelled with more,
The gift was turned to glutton’s curse,
And spilled upon the shore.

So feasting drowned the fair green land,
The valleys sank away,
And only waves keep memory now,
Of Lyonesse’s day.
