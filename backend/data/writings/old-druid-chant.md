Hand in hand in forests nave  
Around The Stone a world to save,  
Rowan, Moyra, Merlin, and Maven  
With Morgan and Danu form a haven,  
Remus, Lethe, Loran and Flore  
With Auberon’s wisdom kindle the aura,  
Babel’s voice the doomed allures  
Fauna’s sense the beasts ensues  
Flora speaks through branch and root  
Titania serves forbidden fruit  
And Deva does what she knows best  
Lays the souls of all to rest
