“In the beginning there was Darkness and the Darkness was without form and was upon the face of the deep. And the Darkness was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld its glory, the glory as of the only one begotten of the void, full of grace and truth.”

 — **Echoes of Cimeron 1:1**

“Four decades after Phaionios’ ascension, Armozel was growing restless. His craft and skill had given him everything he could wish for, so the Deceiver laid out a trap for him and showed him he had yet more to gain. In the guise of the angel Chamuel, he visited Armozel in a dream and led him under the great mountain Medula, beyond the holy seals laid down by the fourth redeemer, and showed him endless halls and chambers where cold metal lined the walls while glistening stones shone the way.

Without seeking guidance from the Allfather, once again, Armozel raised the Sons of the Light, the great host of paladins who had fought with him and Phaionios during the great purge of Evil. His desire for the riches kept by the dungeons beneath the mountain and the pride welling up inside him at the sight of thousands of his holy knights standing before him caused him to disregard God’s peace. And the seals were shattered.

For one day and one night, the Sons of the Light rode through the gates of Medula, descending into the mountain, singing praises to the Lord and shouting taunts at the dark forces that surely awaited them within. Armozel, who was riding mid-column, entered the mountain at sunset.

Neither he, nor a single one of his shining paladins, was ever seen again.”
