Birds on wings and trees on foot  
Dwarfs all covered up in soot  
Goblin, Goblin, go away  
Home to nasty forest Fay  

Whyvern singing songs of joy?  
Griffin eating farmers boy?!  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Before I see the monkeys fly!!  

If trolls and ogres eat my mom  
I doubt my father will stay calm  
I hope and pray for every day  
That filthy Fay will stay away!
