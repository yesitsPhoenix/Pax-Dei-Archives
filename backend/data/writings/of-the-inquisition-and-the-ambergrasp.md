To the Most Reverend Father, Keeper of the Keys,

Be it known that certain specimens, lately transported from the province of Lyonesse, have been placed into the custody of the Papal Arcanists for trial and discernment. The plant in question bears dark and thornéd boughs, yet within them runs a golden sap that glows and hums with uncommon force. The learned masters have given it the name Ambergrasp.

The first examinations have yielded most favorable signs. Distillations of the sap did stir the air as though graced by a hidden breath, and when applied to relics of minor sanctity, the objects shone more brightly and seemed to answer to prayer with greater fervor. In disputation, it was concluded that within this sap abides some portion of divine spirit, not unlike the virtue that clings to the bones of martyrs or the stones of ancient shrines. The masters are confident it may serve to fashion relics and artefacts, or to lend new fire to miracles.

Encouraged by these findings, the Arcanists humbly petition leave to establish an outpost within Lyonesse itself, so that they may conduct their operations upon the field. They believe that by certain arts of soil and blessing, the growth of Ambergrasp may be hastened, and its yield multiplied.

This officer recommends the request be granted, for the gain of Holy Church and the discomfiture of her enemies.
