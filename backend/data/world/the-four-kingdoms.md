**Gallia**
* **Legacy:** Known as a land of "Arches that Breathe," influenced heavily by **Eleleth** (the Architect of Light) and the **Gallian Compagnons**.
* **Culture:** A center for sacred architecture and divine glasswork, where the Pax Dei was preserved within its valleys through quiet labor and secret masonry.
* **Current State:** Deeply affected by the Cleansing; its highest fortresses were breached by corruption, leaving its master builders to safeguard the remnants of sacred geometry in the shadows.

**Gothia**
* **Legacy:** A land of "Snow and Ash," where the shamanic traditions of **Haljaska** and the war-chants of the **Wild Firsts** endure.
* **Culture:** Home to the **Sanctum Compact**, a patchwork of herbalists and wandering knights who utilize ancestral oaths and thread-magic to bind spirits.
* **Current State:** Though its central thrones fell long ago, the Gothian people survive in the fractured landscape by mapping hidden paths and building shelters from the stones of the past.

**Iberia**
* **Legacy:** Historically a bastion of zealots and steel, where **Zahariah** (The Mist of the Forge) once whispered blessings into Spanish blade-craft.
* **Culture:** Deeply tied to the Papacy, its people were known for their unwavering—and sometimes blind—devotion to the Holy See.
* **Current State:** The first kingdom to dissolve during the Great Cataclysm. Its cities did not fall to siege but were consumed from within; its fountains ran black, and its people were fundamentally changed by the demonic songs of the catacombs.

**Anatolia**
* **Legacy:** The "Last Great Bastion" of human will, tempered by the teachings of **Armozel** and the legends of **Djannara** (the Djinn in Flesh).
* **Culture:** A kingdom of mountain holds, desert libraries, and philosopher-warriors who studied the names of demons to unmake them. 
* **Current State:** The primary source of the first rebellions against Papal corruption. It remains the birthplace of the **Covenant of the Last Ember** and the **Children of the Light**, who fight to rekindle the knowledge of the Ancients.
