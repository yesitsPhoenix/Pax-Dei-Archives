**Origin and Significance:**
* Known as the "Sacred Heart of the World," it is the site where the **First Redeemer, Protennoia**, gave birth to Humanity and where the Divine Tree once stood.
* It has served as the ultimate sanctuary for mankind across multiple ages, most notably during **The Great Surge**, when its walls held against the legions of Hell.

**The Sepulcher of Love:**
* Located at the city's center, this site houses the remains of the **World Tree**. Though the tree withered after the first sin, it bloomed again during the First Crusade, watered by the "tears of hope" from the faithful.
* Beneath the city lies the lowest vault, rumored to be the final resting place and sepulcher of **Eleleth, the Seventh Redeemer**.

**Current State:**
* Following the divine fire of **Phaionios**, the city was left blackened and its Ley Lines scorched. It was abandoned in reverence rather than grief, becoming a shrine to the sacrifices made for humanity.
* During the **Age of the Papacy**, the gates were briefly reopened, but in the wake of the **Great Cataclysm**, the earth beneath the city has begun to stir, and its sacred stones have begun to crack.
