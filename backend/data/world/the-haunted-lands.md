**Formation:**
* These regions were created during the **First Crusade** when the Archangel **Phaionios** unleashed divine fire to eradicate the demonic surge.
* The fire was so intense that it consumed the "spirit" of the land itself, leaving vast areas—stretching from Axis Mundi through the hearts of **Gothia, Gallia, and Iberia**—spiritually hollow.

**Nature and Denizens:**
* **Spiritual Void:** These lands are "invisible" to the Divine and largely ignored by the forces of Evil, as there is little spirit left to corrupt or claim.
* **The Lost:** They are inhabited primarily by **ghosts and lost souls** who cannot pass into the Beyond due to the tearing of the veil between the flesh and spirit realms.
* **The Feral:** Animals that wander into these territories often lose their way, becoming part of the landscape’s aimless, sorrowful existence.

**The Veil:**
* In these regions, the boundary between the mortal world and the echoes of the **Nine Creations** is thinnest, making them sites of frightening wonder and permanent mourning.
