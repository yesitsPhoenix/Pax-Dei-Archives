**Nature and Agency:**
* The Divine is the ultimate, multi-faceted creator of existence, often referred to in the collective plural ("The Divine," "Them," "Their").
* Their interaction with the world is cyclical, alternating between periods of active intervention—sending **Redeemers** to guide or save humanity—and long eras of "Divine Silence" where mankind is left to its own will.

**The Ten Creations:**
* The Divine is not a static creator but a transformative one; the current world is the **Tenth Creation**, built upon the spiritual and physical layers of nine failed predecessors.
* Each new Creation serves as a divine response to the sins of the last, weaving a specific **Heavenly Virtue** into the fabric of the world to counter the "rot" of the past.

**Judgment and The Cleansing:**
* The Divine is capable of both profound mercy and terrifying wrath. This is evidenced by the **Great Deluge** intended to cleanse the world during Demira's age and the recent **Cleansing** following the death of Loïos.
* When the "Divine Eye" opens, reality itself shatters, resetting the balance of seasons and elements through cataclysmic events like iron rain and the cessation of the sun.

**The Redeemers:**
* The Divine acts through chosen vessels, ranging from the **Cherubim Meirothea** and the **Archangel Phaionios** to elevated mortals like **Armozel**.
* These figures are extensions of the Divine's will, sent to provide humanity with the tools for survival: birth, language, agriculture, law, and resilience.

**The Current State:**
* In the wake of the **Great Cataclysm**, the Divine appears to have withdrawn once more, leaving the **Scions**—the "Heirs to Creation’s Sap"—as the final potential conduits of Their lingering grace.
