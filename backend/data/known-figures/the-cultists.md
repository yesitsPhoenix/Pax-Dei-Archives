**Origin and Influence:**
* Cultists represent the "cracks" within human civilization, emerging during the **Age of the Kingdoms** as secret societies (assassins, acolytes, and crypt-dwellers) hiding in the shadows of prosperity.
* They serve as the mortal conduit for the return of ancient sins, trading in relics recovered from the **Great Surge** and the ruins of fallen empires like **Carpathia**.

**Operations and Hierarchy:**
* **The Rivulets:** Cultists inhabit the shallowest layers of the underworld, known as Rivulets. These are twisted, man-made lairs built to facilitate the descent of sin into the deeper roots of Creation.
* **Corruptive Methods:** In the current **Great Cataclysm**, they operate with "smiles and honeyed scripture," using promises and deception to turn villages and bourgs when martial strength is insufficient.
* **Brutality:** To those who resist, they are known for extreme cruelty—torturing the unyielding and displaying remains as warnings etched in bone.

**Spiritual Alignment:**
* Many cultists align themselves with the **Princes of Hell** (such as Zeb, Mammon, and Moloch), seeking to unseal the paths to the underworld first barred by **Armozel** and **Eleleth**.
* They stand in direct opposition to the **Keepers of Hidden Light** and the **Scions**, working to accelerate the rot that threatens the remaining sanctuaries of the **Pax Dei**.
