**Origin and Emergence:**
* Scions appeared suddenly in the wake of the **Great Cataclysm** and the death of **Loïos**; they did not arrive through birth or descent but manifested as full-grown, "quiet" individuals within the ruins of the world.
* The druids identify them as the "Heirs to Creation’s Sap," suggesting they are physical vessels for the accumulated knowledge and spirit of the **Tenth Creation** that was thought to be lost.

**Characteristics and Nature:**
* **Innate Mastery:** They possess the ability to use tools and crafts they never learned and navigate ruins as if the stones themselves are providing them with memory.
* **Resilience:** Unlike common mortals, they "fall and yet they rise," possessing a unique connection to the **Pax Dei** that allows them to endure the spiritual and physical hazards of the fractured world.
* **The Forgotten Dream:** They are often described as having the gaze of those recalling a dream, acting as the bridge between the tattered history of the **Redeemers** and the uncertain future of humanity.

**Societal Reception:**
* **The Inquisition:** Officially brands Scions as "blasphemies" and "unmade" things, fearing their untethered power and seeking to hunt them to extinction.
* **The Righteous:** Fellowship groups and hidden sanctuaries view the Scions as the final thread of hope, the only ones capable of walking the **Haunted Lands** without fear and restoring the balance lost during the Cleansing.
