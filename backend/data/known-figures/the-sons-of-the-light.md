**Foundation and Purpose:**
* Formed during **The Great Surge** by **Armozel**, the Fifth Redeemer, as the first unified resistance against the demonic tempest.
* They were born from the desperate survivors of fallen kingdoms who rallied to Armozel’s banner, infused with divine inspiration and bravery.

**Legacy and Martial Art:**
* **Divine Craftsmanship:** The order was the first to utilize Armozel’s sacred geometry and divine metallurgy, wielding weapons and armor imbued with spirit and the patterns of the Ley Lines.
* **The First Crusade:** They served as the "Shining Legion" that defended **Axis Mundi** and followed the Archangel **Phaionios** to hunt the remains of evil across the continent.
* **The Final Fall:** The original order followed Armozel into the depths of **Mount Medula** during his fall to Pride; none of those who entered ever returned.
* **Modern Successors:** In the current **Great Cataclysm**, new fellowships like the **Children of the Light** study the ancient designs of the Sons to reforge their iron and purpose against the darkness.
