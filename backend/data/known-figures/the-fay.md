**Ancient Origins:**
* The Fay are the "firstborn of an older grace," survivors from one of the **Nine Creations** that existed before the current world.
* They reside in hidden realms, groves, and sanctuaries where the veil between the Tenth Creation and the older worlds is thin.

**Nature and Influence:**
* **Guardians of Remnants:** The Fay are known to have saved various non-human beings (such as trolls and wyverns) from shattered ages, bringing them into their hidden domains.
* **Allies of the Redeemers:** They have historically stepped out of the shadows to assist mankind in times of crisis, standing beside **Meirothea** against Moloch and aiding **Demira** and **Eleleth** in crafting sacred seals and the Ancient Stela.
* **The Fading:** Following the **Elysium Age**, the Fay largely receded from the world of Man. In the current **Great Cataclysm**, they remain a source of "forgotten whole" knowledge for those seekers, like **Eleleth**, who are brave enough to listen to their silence.
