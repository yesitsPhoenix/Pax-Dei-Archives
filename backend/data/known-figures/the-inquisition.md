**Origin and Purpose:**
* Established by **Pope Malhenus** during the **Age of the Papacy**, the Inquisition was originally modeled after the military structure of **Anatolia** to defend the Holy See.
* Over centuries, it transitioned from a defensive force into the realm's greatest military power, prioritizing the enforcement of Church doctrine over the protection of the kingdoms.

**Role in the Cataclysm:**
* **Persecution of Knowledge:** During the later Papal years, the Inquisition targeted those who remembered ancient truths, including the **Fay**, shamans, and the **House of Thornwood**.
* **Condemnation of the Righteous:** In the current era, they brand many of the world's true protectors—such as the **House of Sunshield** and the **Knights of Valour**—as heretics and blasphemies.
* **The Scion Conflict:** They view the emergence of **Scions** as an ultimate affront to divine order, seeking to "unmake" these individuals despite the Scions' inherent connection to the world's survival.
