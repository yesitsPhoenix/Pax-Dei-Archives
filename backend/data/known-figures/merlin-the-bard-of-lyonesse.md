Merlin was also mentioned in an old druid chant:

> <em>"Hand in hand in forests nave; Around The Stone a world to save;
> Rowan, Moyra, Merlin and Maven; With Morgan and Danu form a haven;
> Remus, Lethe, Loran and Flora; With Auberon’s wisdom kindle the aura;
> Babel’s voice the doomed allures; Fauna’s sense the beasts ensues;
> Flora speaks through branch and root; Titania serves forbidden fruit;
> And Deva does what she knows best; Lays the souls of all to rest"</em>
