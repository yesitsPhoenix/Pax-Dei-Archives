**Origins and Nature:**
* The Princes are the primordial embodiments of the Seven Deadly Sins, some of whom (like the **Great Deceiver** and **Leviathan**) originate from the corruption of the **Nine Creations** that predated our own.
* They exist in the deepest domains beneath the world—shrine-like voids excreted by suffering where the Tenth Creation ends and Hell begins.

**Key Figures and Torment:**
* **Moloch (Wrath):** Rose in the Age of Meirothea to lead a demonic army; his beasts tore at the foundations of early human culture.
* **Zeb (Gluttony) & Mammon (Greed):** Emerged during the Age of Demira to corrupt the abundance of agriculture and craft.
* **The Curse of Demira:** Upon her sacrifice, the Third Redeemer cursed these Princes with a shard of her spirit, turning their sins into eternal suffering—they now hunger without satiation and rage without calm.
* **The Carpathia Prince:** A Prince of Hell (cloaked in glory) secretly ruled the kingdom of **Carpathia** during the Elysium Age, masquerading as a beacon of perfection to plant the seeds of Pride.
