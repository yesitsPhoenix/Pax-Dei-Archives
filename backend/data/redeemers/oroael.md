The Sixth Redeemer, Oroael, inhabited and walked the land as a teacher during the Age of Legends, between 1950-2350.

After the wrath and destruction of Armozel and Phaionios, Oroael brought balance, kindness, and wisdom.

> From his wisdom came the first monasteries, carved into old places of power. His followers raised shrines and gardens, taught healing, music, scripture, and sacred labor. His calendar ordered the days, his prayers greeted sunrise and moonrise alike. He gave us the Rule of Life, not with command, but with clarity. And though he never ruled a nation, his words governed the hearts of nations to come
