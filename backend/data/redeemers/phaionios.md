The Fourth Redeemer, Phaionios, the Archangel of Flame, decended from heaven during the Great Surge, between 1930-1950.

> It was then that Phaionios, the Archangel of Flame and Fourth Redeemer, descended from Heaven, imbued with Divine Wrath. The mighty gates of Axis Mundi were thrown open and the demon hordes fell silent as the fiery seraph emerged. Ahead of him came fire and fury, in his wake marched the Sons of the Light in all their glory, and in his hands, he wielded a divine weapon of unmatched devastation that in one fell swoop crushed the demon horde, sending waves of divine fire emanating from Axis Mundi and eventually throughout all of creation, like ripples in a pond. Thousands of refugees, paladins, and artisans were caught in the blaze, their souls never laid to rest. Only Anatolia was spared.

Because of the extend of Phaionios' wrath, the lands of Gothia, Gallia, and Iberia became devoid of spirit. Today, these remnants can be witnessed throughout the lands where Lost Souls inhabit forlorn and forgotten places in the world.

Phaionios joined forces with Armozel to crush evil, and secure the land, utlimately leading the First Crusade.
> Their crusade became legend. Together, they reignited the Ancient Stela, enabling fallen warriors to rise again. They raised watchtowers at the edges of known lands, engineered fortresses to guard the borders of each province as Evil was uprooted and sealed the underworld’s paths.
>
> This was the First Crusade, and it delivered mankind from annihilation.

After the last of the demonic gates was closed and sealed, Phaionios departed back to heaven.
