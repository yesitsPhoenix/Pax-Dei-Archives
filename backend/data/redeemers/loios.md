The Ninth Redeemer, Loios, humbly and quietly arrived during the Age of the Papacy.

After more than eight centuries, a new Redeemer arrived at the gates of Axis Mundi.

> He carried no seal and wore no title. He asked for no crown, made no claim. He only asked the people to rest, to remember, to listen. His voice was quiet.

> He never reached the altar.

> Some say it was fever. Others whisper poison. Some believe no Redeemer dies without purpose.

> After his death, the Petra Dei began to hum. The leylines rippled. And though the cathedrals still stood, the earth beneath them had begun to stir.

His death brought about the end of the Age of the Papacy
