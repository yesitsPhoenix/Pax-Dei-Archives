The Eight Redeemer, Mellaphaneous, brought peace and order during her time. She arose during the Age of the Papacy between 2996-3900.

Mallephaneous also raised the first Petrae Dei stones, carved from granite, engraved with sigils, and embedded within a relic from Oroael.

> With scripture in her left hand and the seal of the Divine in her right, she reopened the gates of Axis Mundi, restoring communion between the Four Kingdoms. Her voice was not loud, it was final. Her word ended quarrels, stilled armies, and bound kings to a common path.

> In her time, the first Petrae Dei were raised: great standing stones, carved from sacred granite and engraved with the sigils of the Holy See. Within each, it is said, was set a relic from the monastery of Oroael, touched by the Sixth Redeemer himself. These stones carried doctrine across the realm, and when needed, called the faithful to arms… or sent the Papal troops to a valley. They became pillars of unity, and of discipline.


> Mellephaneous ruled for one hundred and twelve years, unwavering, untiring, unchanged. When she vanished, no tomb was found—only her robes remained, folded upon the seat of judgment.

> She left behind a world of peace.
