The Third Redeemer, Demira, rose during the Age of the Ancients, between 876-1050. She brought agriculture, care, and craft.

> Demira gave strength to the body and gentleness to the hand.
>
> She taught us to till the earth, to plant and reap, to tend to beasts not for domination but companionship.
>
> Yet her greatest gift was care itself, a virtue that flowed into every act of tending, healing, and nurturing, be it child or soil, lamb or elder.
>
> Under her guidance we learned to build homes, raise herds, and create the first true communities.

Demira's breath brought about the season of Spring, and it was said that her tears produced the first Autumn rain, for before her, there was only Summer and Winter.She brought about seasons, giving the world birth and life in Spring and harvest and reflesion in Autumn.

> With harvest came abundance, and from abundance, indulgence. 
> 
> With craftmanship came wealth, and with wealth; envy and hoarding
> 
> With communities came rumors and suspiciouns toward ones neighbors
> 
> The sins of Gluttony, Greed, and Wrath stirred again, and their princes Zeb, Mammon, and Moloch returned with armies of corruption

Demira allied with the Fay and created the Ancient Stela across Creation to shelter the faithful and stand as beacons agains the encroaching darkness. She pleaded to the Divine to save the innocent, in sorrow out of love. She sacrificed everything, including herself, to stem the tide of darkness.


> Demira fashioned not a wooden ark, but a spiritual sanctuary woven from her very being. With her Shepherds, she sought out the worthy. As the waters rose and the world drowned, she held fast. And when the deluge reached its ultimate height, she sacrificed herself, cursing Zeb, Mammon, and Moloch with eternal torment. They would hunger and never be sated, desire and never be fulfilled, rage and never be calmed.

> Her body, untouched by decay, was seen floating above Axis Mundi, and dissolving into droplets of grace, falling onto what remained of Protennoia’s Tree. Her essence flowed into the Ley Lines, weaving a great network of life, memory, and power. The Pax Dei, fragile but enduring, grew from her roots.

> To this day, when the Autumn rains fall cold and sudden, the old say it is Demira weeping, not for those she saved, but for those she could not.
