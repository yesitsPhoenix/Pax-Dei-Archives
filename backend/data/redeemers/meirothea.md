The Second Redeemer, Meirothea, was a cherubim of flowing voice and luminous form. She rose during the Age of the Ancients, between 350-500. She brought language, songs, symbols, memory, and ultimately culture to us.

> She gave us language that we might name what we feared
> 
> She gave us songs, to remember what we loved
> 
> She gave us symobls, to preserve what we've learned

> With her gifts, we crossed the threshold from survival to culture.

Noteably, birds came in her time, or returned, and wolves were drawn to her.
> Some say they [birds] were not born here, but slipped through from the old worlds of Heaven and fay, drawn by the sound of Meirothea's voice.
>
> Wolves abandoned the wild and were drawn to her. Under her gaze they howled not in rage, but in reverence. They became her slient allies, not servants, but spirits of understanding and strength.

Meirothea was responsible for placing the moon into the sky of Gallia. Under Meirothea, winter became a season of reflection, a time to remember and prepare.
