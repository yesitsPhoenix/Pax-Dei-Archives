The Seventh Redeemer, Eleleth, rose during the Age of the Kingdoms, between 2350-2966 as a bishop from the city of Monastir.

Eleleth wanted to understand her enemies, not just crush them. She studied them, gathering scrolls and wisdom. She brought us wards, potions, and so much more.

She even sealed the Crucible of Thorns.

> She studied the Enemy not to worship, but to understand. From ruins, scrolls, wild tribes, and the silence of the Fay, she gathered broken parts of a forgotten whole. Her gifts were many, wards, potions, tattoos, glyphs, binding salts, and structures that spoke in silence. She sealed the Crucible of Thorns, the deepest wound still open in Creation. It bears her mark still.

She was known by several names across Creation:
- Anatolia - Djannara (meaning: Djinn in Flesh)
- Iberia - Zahariah (meaning: The Mist of the Forge)
- Gallia - Cléveria (meaning: the Architect of Light)
- Gothia - Haljaska (meaning: She Who Knows the Ash-Song)

Her teachings brought about many orders, one of which Thelonius was known to represent:
- Wardens of the Veil
- Acolytes of the Unseen Thread
- Keepers of Hidden Light

> From her teachings sprang many orders, some cloaked in secrecy, others named in daylight. The most visible were the Wardens of the Veil, builders of glyph-marked towers along leyline thresholds. Another, far quieter, were the Acolytes of the Unseen Thread, who stitched charms into cloaks and warded dreams with signs. Few of these orders are known to remain. Only the Keepers of Hidden Light endure, watching, not claiming.

> There came a time when these orders rose together. Not with swords, but with signs and words. Not with battle cries, but with silence. Scholars later called it the Silent Crusade, a war of seals, memory, and song. Corruption was turned back not by armies, but by rites. Glyphs sang to the walls. Ink held back the dark.
